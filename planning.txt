Gamehost
- Opens and closes game 'instances'
- Loads menus and stores player data

settings.py

> Menu
- Renders menu from json files
>> Menu elements (buttons) - like html
- Allows the mouse to interact with elements like a webpage

> Game
>> Map (renders the environment from json files - each map has a different json file)
-  Camera (the tiles are drawn according to the coordinates of the camera - which usually follows the location of the player. this class allows flexibility in case I decide later that I don't want the camera following the player all the time)
-  Regular Tiles - (non-movable tiles. tiles have 'IDs' and tiledata such as the image/animation is stored in json files)
-  Tile variants/puzzle tiles - movable tiles that are part of the puzzle or tiles that interact with the player
>> Sound - handles the sound
>> Player - handles the functionality of the player - checking the movement and collisions
-  PlayerAnimations - handles drawing the player (image/animation)
>> Background - draws the background (drawn before the tiles)
>> InputHandler - handles input - from controllers/mouse/keyboard
>> HUD - draws the HUD of the player when in game (drawn last)
