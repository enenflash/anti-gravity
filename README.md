## **Project Overview**
- Investigation: Research ideas, deconstruct the problem and choose a game option from the list provided.
- Design: Produce detailed design documents (diagrams, pseudocode, class diagrams) that clearly incorporate object-orientated programming (OOP) techniques such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction
- Development: Code your game following your design. Your solution should demonstrate control structures, modular coding, good programming practises (e.g. version control, commenting, error handling) and robust testing.
- Evaluation: Test, debug and evaluate your game's functionaility. Include a reflective discussion on your design choices and ethical/legal considerations where relevant.

## **Game choice: Puzzle Maze**
- A game that challenges players to solve puzzles or navigate mazes with increasing difficulty.
- OOP Elements: Implement different puzzle types as subclasses of a generic puzzle class; include abstraction in how puzzles are presented and solved.
