Computer Science ATAR PyGame Python Project

1. Project Overview
   > Investigation: Research ideas, deconstruct the problem and choose a game option from the list provided.
   > Design: Produce detailed design documents (diagrams, pseudocode, class diagrams) that clearly incorporate object-orientated programming (OOP) techniques such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction
   > Development: Code your game following your design. Your solution should demonstrate control structures, modular coding, good programming practises (e.g. version control, commenting, error handling) and robust testing.
   > Evaluation: Test, debug and evaluate your game's functionaility. Include a reflective discussion on your design choices and ethical/legal considerations where relevant.
